.Sh NAME
.Nm cp_metaio
.Nd Copy two files carrying I/O metadata
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cp_metaio
.Ar from_filename1 to_filename1 from_filename2 to_filename2
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
Copy the contents of
.Fa from_filename1
to
.Fa to_filename1
and the contents of
.Fa from_filename2
to
.Fa to_filename2
while preserving I/O metadata.
This is a simple demonstration program and no more;
.Xr cp 1
should be used to copy files in a generalized way, and is far more
feature rich.
